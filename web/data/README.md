# Static data files

## `agg_stark.vk`

The **aggregation STARK verifying key** — a bitcode-encoded `AggStarkVerifyingKey`
that captures the circuit structure of the OpenVM aggregation STARK.

### Origin

Generated by the OpenVM toolchain setup command:

```bash
cargo openvm setup          # writes to ~/.openvm/agg_stark.vk
```

Then copied here so it can be served as a static asset at `/data/agg_stark.vk`.

### Properties

- **Deterministic**: identical for every user on the same OpenVM toolchain version.
- **Version-specific**: must be regenerated when the OpenVM version changes.
- **Size**: ~114 KB.

### How it is used

At runtime the client fetches this file, then appends two program-specific
commits (`app_exe_commit` and `app_vm_commit`, bitcode-encoded in BabyBear
Montgomery form) to produce the full `VmStarkVerifyingKey` expected by
`verify_stark()`.

See `web/assets/proof-utils.js` → `constructVmStarkVk()` for the construction
logic.
